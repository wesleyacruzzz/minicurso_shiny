Quick Course: How to build web application using R Shiny

# Overview
In this course I taught at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) we touched the basic structure of a native web application with Shiny, the files configurations, difference between Ui, Server, and Global.

The first day was all about the concepts and the second day was a hands-on experience as the students built their own applications using what was learned.

Overall was a really positive interation and I hope to do it again in the future!
